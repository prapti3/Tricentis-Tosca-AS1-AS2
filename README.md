### Single User Workspace
- A local workspace used by one user only.
- No synchronization or version control with a shared repository.

<br>

#### 🔹 Key Points:
```
❌ No check-in/check-out mechanism.
✅ Changes are saved directly and locally.
❌ Cannot collaborate with team members simultaneously.
✅ Easier setup; no need to configure Tosca Server or repository.

```

<br>


### 🔹 When to Use:
- For training or learning Tosca.

## Multi User Workspace
```
🔹 What is a Multi User Workspace?
- A collaborative workspace setup where multiple testers work on the same Tosca project.
- Connected to a common central repository (Tosca Server or TDS – Tosca Distributed Server).

#### 🔹 Key Points:
```
- ✅ Supports check-in / check-out functionality.
- ✅ Enables team collaboration and version control.
- ✅ Prevents conflicts by locking objects when edited.
